# LLM_climate_project

This is where I'll store code and notes on the climate project I'm working on.

So far I've been researching and reviewing literature etc. I've decided to use Meteostat API and LangChain to create a 'talk to your data' application for climate data. Currently looking into both platforms and will start working on code shortly. All will be uploaded here.

# Progress Log

Will keep track of all changes and thoughts throughout the project here.

## 1 Initial testing with Meteostat JSON API

From online, the following should be done to obtain an API key for Meteostat:
1.) Sign up to RapidAPI
2.) Subscribe to Meteostat API
3.) Meteostat API documentation > Header Parameters > X-RapidAPI-Key

This key can be used to initially test out the API and check that it's fetching data as expected. Initially, I'm having errors stating 'you are not subscribed to this API' so will wait since it might take some time for my subscription to go through.
