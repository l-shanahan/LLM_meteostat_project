# LLM_climate_project

This is where I'll store code and notes on the climate project I'm working on.

So far I've been researching and reviewing literature etc. I've decided to use Meteostat API and LangChain to create a 'talk to your data' application for climate data. Currently looking into both platforms and will start working on code shortly. All will be uploaded here.
